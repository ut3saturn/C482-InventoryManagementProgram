Inventory Management Program 

Manage an inventory of products and parts. The inventory is comprised of both products and parts. 

Products contain, and must have at least one, associated parts. 

Parts are classified as either in-house or outsourced, that is, the Part class is abstract and both in-house and outsourced inherit from Part.

Create, modify, or delete a part. Create a product and add parts to the product. Modify or delete a product.

The inventory exists and cannot be created or deleted, only modified as parts and products are added, modified, or removed from the inventory.
